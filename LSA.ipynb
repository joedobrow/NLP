Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",

      "Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event . She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost . She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago . How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !                                                                                                            0.543148\n",

Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.488392\n",

The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name . She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible . No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , \" Beg her to walk up ;\" and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .

And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not . It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two  or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .    0.500957\n",
